### Overview
An independently developed pixel RPG with a dark, atmospheric world reminiscent of **Dark Souls**. The game features challenging combat, exploration, and a story filled with mystery and despair. Unlike many RPGs, the protagonist in this game has no name, allowing players to project their own identity into the character and immerse themselves deeply into the world.

### Key Features
- **Atmospheric Pixel Art**: A world crafted with detailed pixel art, blending retro aesthetics with a hauntingly beautiful design. Dark, foreboding environments echo the eerie landscapes of Dark Souls.
- **Challenging Combat**: Combat requires precise timing, strategy, and patience. Every encounter can be deadly if approached carelessly, with each enemy presenting a unique challenge.
- **Exploration**: A vast, interconnected world full of hidden secrets, dangerous dungeons, and forgotten lore. The game encourages exploration and rewards curiosity, but danger lurks around every corner.
- **Lore and Mystery**: The story is told through the environment, cryptic NPC dialogues, and item descriptions, encouraging players to piece together the world’s lore themselves.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Stamina-Based Combat**: Similar to Dark Souls, every action—whether attacking, dodging, or blocking—consumes stamina, requiring careful management of resources during battle.
- **Resting at Bonfire-like Locations**: Scattered across the world are rest points where players can heal, recover, and manage their progression. However, resting respawns enemies, adding a layer of strategy to when and where players choose to rest.
- **Leveling System**: Players can level up by gathering experience points from defeated enemies, increasing stats such as strength, dexterity, and endurance. Choices in stat allocation directly influence combat style.

### Story Overview
The world is bleak, filled with remnants of a once-great civilization now fallen into ruin. As the unnamed protagonist, you awaken with no memory of who you are or how you arrived. You must journey through this decaying world, facing monstrous foes, unraveling cryptic messages, and discovering your purpose. Every decision made will shape your fate and the outcome of the world’s ongoing decay.

### Inspiration
- **Dark Souls**: The game takes heavy inspiration from the Dark Souls series, particularly in its approach to combat, exploration, and environmental storytelling.
- **Pixel Art RPGs**: The art style combines retro aesthetics with modern design principles, evoking the charm of classic RPGs with the intensity of modern action games.
