### Overview
This is a multiplayer MOBA game, developed in 2017, using the Unity 5 engine. It was the first game I almost fully completed on my own. I even invited my classmates and roommates to help me test it. Players can choose one of two heroes to engage in battles, and the gameplay is very similar to *Dota 2* and *League of Legends*. The game supports LAN multiplayer and includes an in-game chat feature.

### Key Features
- **Cute Character Design**: I designed how my characters should look like and created them by 3D modeling.
- **LAN Multiplayer**: The multiplayer module is made by Unity Network.
- **In-game Chat**: I used Socket.IO to build the in-game chat system.
- **Unique Skills**: Each character has her own unique abilities and skills.
