### Overview

During my internship at **Uken**, a game company based in Toronto, I contributed to various projects and gained valuable experience in game development.

### Contributions

- **In-Game Store for Christmas Event**: Developed the in-game store feature specifically for the Christmas event. Implemented functionality to fetch back-end data and display new items in the shop.
- **Player Feedback System**: Created an in-game feedback system allowing users to send messages directly to the companyâ€™s community manager, enhancing player communication and support.
- **AR Feature Maintenance**: Maintained the augmented reality (AR) feature, which enabled multiple players to enjoy the pool game together in an augmented reality environment.
- **Game Prototyping**: Designed and prototyped a mobile sushi-making game where players follow recipes to create various sushi dishes.
